### Tissue
Sperm were extracted from mice across several generations (F0-F3)

### Genome
Data were aligned to mm10 version of the mouse genome.

### Concept
Mice were treated either with folic acid (FA) or controls (DDI) in F0, then left untreated up to F3. Sperm was extracted from males from all generations, then compared for differences in DNA methylation
